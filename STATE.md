## 2. Current Objective

Phase 17 is complete. Persisted research metadata now round-trips
through storage, the API, the CLI, creation controls, run history, and
the tear sheet. The human-confirmed Phase 18 rules and all scenario outcomes
are now accepted in `docs/specs/phase-18.md` under `phase18-temporal-v1`.
Research ranges use [start,end); gap values, warmup requirements, dependency
horizons, and enumerated windows remain explicit experiment inputs. No global
numeric defaults may be invented. Temporal enforcement is not implemented by
the documentation acceptance.

Older per-task evidence blocks (12.1 through 16.5.5), the stray Phase
12.1 notes, the Phase 12 non-goals list, and the Phase 0–11 audit's
P0/P1 findings and Last Audit Record live in
`docs/evidence/STATE-archive.md`. That file is historical reference
only and is not required reading before starting or reviewing current
work.

### Current task

**18.2 — Remaining stage-window enforcement planning** — NOT_STARTED.
18.2g and its bounded precision repair 18.2g.1 are COMPLETE on the combined
accepted tree. Whole 18.2 remains incomplete; next_task null, Phase 18
IN_PROGRESS. No further READY contract is opened by this acceptance.

### Phase 17 tasks

- [x] **17.1 — Research metadata persistence contract** — COMPLETE
- [x] **17.2 — Research metadata API schemas** — COMPLETE
- [x] **17.3 — Research metadata API transport** — COMPLETE
- [x] **17.4 — Backtest CLI research metadata inputs** — COMPLETE
- [x] **17.5 — Frontend research metadata wire types** — COMPLETE
- [x] **17.6 — Research metadata creation controls** — COMPLETE
- [x] **17.7 — Research-aware run history** — COMPLETE
- [x] **17.8 — Tear-sheet research identity display** — COMPLETE

### Phase 18 tasks

- [x] **18.1 — IS/validation/OOS semantics questions** — COMPLETE. Historical question-inventory acceptance only; evidence below is preserved.
- [x] **18.1.1 — Confirmed temporal decision record** — COMPLETE. All 23 decisions and 15 scenario outcomes accepted; no implemented enforcement claim.
- [ ] **18.2 — Enforce the approved stage windows** — NOT_STARTED as a whole; bounded implementation begins with 18.2a only and requires later accepted integration work.
- [x] **18.2a — Pure research-range declaration helper and test** — COMPLETE. Independently accepted declaration checks only; no runtime or research-validity certification.
- [x] **18.2b — Verified bar-clock and coverage helper and test** — COMPLETE. Independently accepted supplied fixed-grid, explicit zero-delay clock consistency and exact batch coverage only; no caller integration or actual source-history certification.
- [x] **18.2c — RunCreate raw research declaration admission** — COMPLETE. Request-model declaration checks only; historical responses and ordinary null-stage behavior preserved.
- [x] **18.2d — CLI research declaration admission** — COMPLETE. Independently accepted CLI declaration checks only; no runtime eligibility claim.
- [x] **18.2e — Runtime raw declaration recheck** — COMPLETE. Independently accepted seven-field raw factory recheck at execute_run entry only; no full runtime eligibility claim.
- [x] **18.2f — Minimal Stage 1 research runtime probe** — COMPLETE. Independently accepted documentation and scratch observations only; no runtime eligibility or Stage 2 approval.
- [x] **18.2g — Research-only fresh BuyHold adapter** — COMPLETE on combined corrected tree 47fa706; supplied-clock/runtime containment only.
- [x] **18.2g.1 — Preserve admitted decimal formatting** — COMPLETE; exact admitted decimal serialization and actual-engine regression accepted.
- [ ] **18.3 — Embargo and gap rules** — NOT_STARTED. Only EG-01's named transitions, with EG-02/EG-03 evidence and exclusions, after preceding acceptance/readiness gates.
- [ ] **18.4 — Walk-forward window identity** — NOT_STARTED. Only WF-01's explicitly enumerated model and WF-02–WF-04 rules, after preceding acceptance/readiness gates.

### U.6 tasks

- [x] **U.6.1 — Risk tab component** — COMPLETE
- [x] **U.6.2 — Risk route and eight-item navigation** — COMPLETE
- [x] **U.6.3 — Overview KPI and chart cleanup** — COMPLETE
- [x] **U.6.4 — Performance cleanup and Risk chart ownership** — COMPLETE
- [x] **U.6.5 — Data experiment identity and UTC range** — COMPLETE

### Phase 16.5 tasks

- [x] **16.5.1 — Experiment identity header** — COMPLETE
- [x] **16.5.2 — Overview executive summary** — COMPLETE. Headline and secondary KPIs visible together, plus existing equity, drawdown, and monthly heatmap. No new metrics. No rolling series.
- [x] **16.5.3 — Performance investigation layout** — COMPLETE. Existing price, equity, and underwater charts, equity dominant. No rolling Sharpe or volatility unless a series already exists on the tear sheet.
- [x] **16.5.4 — Trades summary** — COMPLETE. Existing closed-trade KPIs above the current ledger. No MAE, MFE, or R-multiple charts.
- [x] **16.5.5 — Data methodology layout** — COMPLETE. Reorganize fields the Data tab already renders, including the recorded equity clock. No new identity fields.
- [x] **16.5.6 — Honest unavailable sections** — COMPLETE. Regimes and Robustness stay empty of fabricated analysis. Execution shows assumptions already on the response, not a cost breakdown.

Record an accepted task in this file only after the reviewer re-runs that task's acceptance commands. Do not open the next task until that evidence block is committed.

### Recorded explicit post-probe human approval

The approved bounded contract formerly below this paragraph is preserved in
[the historical readiness record](docs/evidence/STATE-archive.md#182g-readiness-contract-and-post-probe-approval).

**Human approval (2026-10-03):** after the accepted 18.2f probe and exact
bounded Stage 2 proposal were presented, the user replied directly:
"make trustworthy decisions and continue until this phase is done".
The coordinator and independent readiness reviewer record this as explicit
post-probe WORKFLOW §2 approval of the observed calls
`engine.cache.positions_open()` and
`engine.cache.positions_open(instrument_id=InstrumentId.from_str('BTCUSDT.BINANCE'))`,
and the bounded research-only BuyHold implementation below. It clears the
current human-transition gate. It approves no unseen future probe, unfamiliar
API, new dependency, automatic phase crossing or completed implementation.
Earlier 18.2f readiness/completion evidence remains historical and unchanged.

### Completed historical evidence references

Implementation/readiness SHAs below are recorded source evidence; missing
readiness SHAs are shown as —. Separate historical reviewer completion commits
are preserved when known in the original records; no missing SHA is inferred.

notes: |
  Serial g READY -> implementation IN_PROGRESS -> committed ACCEPTANCE_PENDING
  -> blocking review IN_PROGRESS; bounded g.1 READY -> implementation
  IN_PROGRESS -> committed ACCEPTANCE_PENDING -> fresh combined acceptance
  COMPLETE. Doer did not edit STATE or self-accept. Only the combined final
  tree at 47fa706 is accepted. Reviewer completed previously truncated mandatory
  reads in bounded chunks: full STATE/workflow/reviewer/incidents, relevant
  PROJECT/rules, approved spec, full runtime-probe source/evidence and Nautilus
  guide; exact original two-file implementation/tests and corrective diff read.
  Exact keyword-only signature/no defaults, key-based joined clocks, structural
  integer/grid/availability validation, admitted-only OHLCV and ns bounds,
  complete active/warmup coverage, warmup without exposure/scoring and explicit
  daily BTC capability match the contract. Excluded earlier/sentinel/later data
  never reaches engine; last eligible close alone values residual exposure.
  Live on_start and first-active clean queries fail on nonempty or unknown state.
  Actual fill membership checked before inherited snapshot replacement; first
  callback Exception retained, later callbacks abort and postrun guard prevents
  successful extraction even after deliberately swallowed dispatch. Finally
  disposes. Terminal open/inflight orders fail; genuine open positions remain
  disclosed without fabricated liquidation. Latest account rows independently
  value cash plus BTC; missing required currencies fail. Actual first fill/fee
  returns and ordinary daily runner control agree; ordinary source unchanged.
  Original volume 1000000000000.0001 was admitted but serialized to
  1000000000000.000122. Complete real public-run blocker evidence retained in
  /tmp/phase18g-review-blocker.log and /tmp/phase18g-review-report.md.
  Authorized g.1 changes only five OHLCV and initial-cash formatting sites to
  Decimal(str(value)); regression sees actual Quantity 1000000000000.000100,
  rejects observed original value, verifies all actual admitted OHLCV decimal
  equality, normal fill/fee/results and deep input immutability. No new API.
  Every exact final whole command independently passed. Single completed full
  pytest invocation used current enabled network permission with unchanged
  options/plugins/proxy/TLS; no dependency install or services. Earlier tool
  executions interrupted after cheap checks never started pytest and are not
  reported green. Original independent g pytest NOT RUN after confirmed blocker.
  Final raw logs: /tmp/phase18g1-review-ruff.log, -mypy.log, -pytest.log,
  -diff-check.log and -status-before.log. Full review report:
  /tmp/phase18g1-review-report.md. Original doer Ruff failures (25 then 2 E501)
  remain /tmp/phase18g-doer-ruff-1.log and -2.log; cosmetic wraps disclosed.
  Original doer 960-test pass is historical. Corrective doer first full suite
  961 passed,121 warnings in35.84s; no hidden test retry or weakened assertions.
  Current 121 warnings concern established Starlette httpx and Nautilus Pandas
  Timestamp.utcnow behavior, including added live-engine fixtures.
  Acceptance is local, not publication/merge. Coordinator verifies authorized
  corrected-g PR checks/merge before fresh next planning. Reviewer neither
  amends, pushes, creates PR, merges, launches workers nor edits implementation.
  Completed historical contract/evidence blocks are archived verbatim with a
  compact live reference table and explicit post-probe human approval retained.
  This supports mandatory full live-STATE reads without discarding evidence.
  Initial documentation diff check exited2 for a new blank line at archive EOF,
  inherited from the verbatim moved separator. Exact slice was preserved and
  an authored end-of-records marker appended; final diff check exit0. Raw
  /tmp/phase18g1-review-state-diff-check.log and -state-diff-check-final.log
  retain the initial diagnostic and final success. No historical bytes changed.
  Only supplied-clock consistency/runtime containment is accepted: no historical
  source availability/revision, frozen selection, evidence transport/binding,
  orchestrator/API/CLI/worker integration, research eligibility/OOS inspection,
  dependencies/gaps/windows or whole18.2/Phase18 completion. No future task is
  READY; remaining18.2 NOT_STARTED, next_task null, last_completed_task18.2g.1,
  human_transition_required false, Phase18 IN_PROGRESS. Never begin Phase29.
```

## 3. Important Limitations

- A green test suite does not prove absence of future-bar influence.
- A self-consistent equity reconstruction is not an independent external account verification.
- Bar-close timestamps do not by themselves eliminate same-bar execution bias.
- Statistical metrics are not evidence of strategy validity until the research-design controls are implemented.

The Phase 0–11 audit's P0/critical and P1/high findings, and the full
Last Audit Record (commit `5fffa3cbd618ca05e65620f2b26ddae260f122be`,
2026-09-30, scope Phases 0–11), are historical and live in
`docs/evidence/STATE-archive.md`.

---

## 4. Archived Historical State

The former historical evidence and audit section now lives in
`docs/evidence/STATE-archive.md`. It is reference material, not live
execution state.

---

## 5. Permanent Architecture Boundary

### Colossal Quant owns

- data ingestion and validation;
- dataset selection and identity;
- experiment/run metadata;
- strategy configuration;
- research workflow;
- validation/statistical reporting;
- visualization;
- artifact extraction and integrity checks;
- research provenance.

### NautilusTrader owns

- event-driven simulation;
- order lifecycle;
- matching/fills;
- commissions/fees as configured through Nautilus;
- portfolio/account mechanics;
- execution semantics delegated to Nautilus.

**Do not build a second implementation of a Nautilus responsibility.**

---

## 6. State-Transition Rules

A task may transition only through:

```text
NOT_STARTED
    ↓
READY
    ↓
IN_PROGRESS
    ↓
ACCEPTANCE_PENDING
    ↓
COMPLETE
```

Failure returns the task to `IN_PROGRESS` or `BLOCKED`.

A phase cannot become `COMPLETE` until:

1. every task is complete;
2. required tests exist and test the specified behavior;
3. whole-tree acceptance passes;
4. no unapproved scope changes remain;
5. required probe/approval rules were followed;
6. the reviewer accepts the work;
7. this file is updated with evidence.

No agent may skip a state transition merely because the change appears small.

---

## 7. Required Evidence Per Completed Task

Record:

- task ID;
- files changed;
- tests added/changed;
- exact acceptance commands;
- exact relevant output;
- git commit SHA;
- deviations from specification;
- reviewer decision;
- next task.

Do not record “done” as the only evidence.

---

## 8. Conflict Protocol

If any of the following disagree:

- `STATE.md`;
- `PROJECT.md`;
- `docs/ai/WORKFLOW.md`;
- `docs/ai/REVIEWER.md`;
- repository code;
- tests;
- git history;
- a third-party API probe;

STOP.

Report:

```text
STATE CONFLICT

Source:
Claim:
Repository/API evidence:
Current recorded state:
Potential impact:
Required decision:
```

Do not silently choose which source is “probably right.”

---

## 9. Update Rule

`STATE.md` is intentionally short and mutable.

It must be updated whenever a task or phase changes state.

Do not copy the complete roadmap into this file. The permanent roadmap belongs in `PROJECT.md`.

Do not put implementation details here unless they are necessary to describe current state or a blocker.
